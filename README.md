# BarStock-Application

Your solution will be evaluated on code organization and structure, readability, maintainability, and responsive design.
Use HTML 5, CSS3, and any javascript libraries/frameworks you prefer.
Your solutions should use concepts of Object Oriented design.

Rules:
	Allow the user to make as many drinks as they can until the ingredients are gone.
	Users can increase the number of each drink.
	Users can decrease the number each of drink.
	When an ingredient runs out, all drinks that require the ingredient can no longer have their order count increased.
	When ingredients are made available(by decreasing a beverage count), all drinks that require it can once again have their order increased.
	When the user places an order, a summary should be displayed on a new screen that prints out the total of each drink and the total number of drinks.

Design:
	The design should be responsive.
	We have included PNG files of every screen.  
	Use any Font Icon library for creating plus and minus icons.
	We have used the font, Source Sans Pro, which is a Google web font.
	The headings (Bar Stock, Orders) are Source Sans Pro Extralight.
	The units of measurement (I.e. ML, OZ) are Source Sans Pro Bold.
	The number of drinks ordered in the interface are Source Sans Pro Bold.
	Everything else is Source Sans Pro Regular.
